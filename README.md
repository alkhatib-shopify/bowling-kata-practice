# bowling-kata-practice

We chose the bowling kata http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata as a starting point, followed it and ended up at what we consider the shameless green code.

From there, we added more tests from exercism.io which introduce new features and since they started failing, we wanted to refactor the code to open it up for extension, but we havenâ€™t found a way to do it yet taking small steps like the book does.


The repo we are working in: https://github.com/alkhatib-shopify/bowling-kata-practice
