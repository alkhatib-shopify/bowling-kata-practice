Session 2 - January 8, 2021:

- After getting the Kata steps working, we introduced the exercism test cases
- The exercism test cases introduced the concept of a valid roll
- In one roll cannot exceed 10 and cannot be negative
    - We added a validation check in the roll function
- Then the sum of rolls in frames, also had similar validation, that the total should be between 0..10
    - At that point, modification was needed
    - We commented out the test
    - identified code smells
          # Code smell
          # - size of the method isn't aligned with other methods in this class
          # - multiple branches of if statement
          #
          # Flocking Rule
          #  - select the parts that are most alike
          #  - find smallest difference
          #  - make smallest change that'll remove the difference
          #
    - Focused ont he multiple branches and used flocking rules to eliminate the conditions
    - The existing method sum_of_balls_in_frame
        Logic was not matching the actual name, it was actually just adding consecutive rolls without considering frames
    - We identified two concepts
        - Concept of a frame bonus
        - Concept of number of rolls in a frame
